# Webwin

**Probably the most detailed Windows 10 port to the web browser**. It's designed to be fast and spot-on to stock Windows 10. (mostly based on Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC 21H2)
<br />
Webwin is still a work in progress as a lot of things still need to be done, but we're pretty close to the barebones of an functional operating system in the web browser.
<br />

## Features:

- Working Taskbar & Start Menu
- Great Windowing
- Pixel-perfect measurements
- Many built-in activities (includes pinball)
- WebwinDLLsâ„¢ (dynamically choose & load links so you can access it on your filter)
- Fast & Lightweight: sub-two-second load time & 300kb size without runtimes (activities), 8.7mb with.
- Developer-friendly experience.
  Dead simple to create a window.

```javascript
createWindow({ title: "test", content: "content" });
```
